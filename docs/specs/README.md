## Spec-Driven Development

Per Daemoniorum's [SDD methodology](../../../../docs/methodologies/SPEC-DRIVEN-DEVELOPMENT.md):

> "Specs model reality. When reality disagrees with the spec, update the spec."

These specs define the expected behavior of Qliphoth components. All implementations
MUST conform to these specifications. When implementation reveals gaps in understanding,
update the spec first, then continue implementation.

## Contributing
